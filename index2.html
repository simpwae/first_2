    <h3>Origins::</h3>
    <p>Chapli Kabab is a popular street food from Peshawar (a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan) and Afghanistan. <br>
         The name Chapli refers to its flat shape, resembling a sandal, as 'chapal' means sandal in Urdu. <br>
         Some also say that Chapli is the derivation of the Pashto word Chaprikh which means 'flat and thin'.</p>
